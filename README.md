The three formulations, the ‘‘stress form’’ and two ‘‘potential forms’’, are first investigated in the absence of traction boundary conditions, by simulating a retracting droplet in a closed, cylindrical container. We show that the three formulations perform similar in terms of accuracy, although the velocity is slightly more accurate for the potential forms. When investigating mesh-convergence, superconvergence of the velocity and chemical potential is observed in the three forms.
